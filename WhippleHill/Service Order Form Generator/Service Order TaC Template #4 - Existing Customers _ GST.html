<li>10.	School obligations concerning project schedule:
    <ol marker-type="lower-alpha">
        <li>Based on the availability of WhippleHill consultants and School representatives, WhippleHill, together with the School, shall schedule Blocks and WhippleHill shall deliver a project schedule to the School within ten (10) business days from the project start date. The School may reschedule Blocks provided the request to reschedule is communicated to WhippleHill more than seven (7) days before the Block start date except, in the event School closings due to any cause beyond the School's reasonable control prevent the school from providing seven (7) days' notice, Blocks or portions thereof will be rescheduled at no penalty to the School.</li>
        
        <li>If the School is unable to meet a scheduled deadline, WhippleHill reserves the right to reschedule all subsequent Blocks subject to availability of WhippleHill consultants. Should the School miss a project deadline by thirty (30) days or more, or is unresponsive to WhippleHill requests for thirty (30) days, all Consulting Services under this Service Order shall be placed in a "Hold Status" and all remaining Blocks will be rescheduled only at such time that School contacts WhippleHill to reschedule.

School shall have the option of terminating Hold Status projects by submitting a request in writing to WhippleHill a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the one hundred eighty (180) day Hold Status period, in which case the School shall receive a credit equivalent to the value of all unused Blocks.</li>

The School shall; 1) complete any remaining training Blocks, 2) complete the  Website content population, and 3) test the public Website pages and report any issues to WhippleHill at least  fifteen (15) business days prior to the desired public Website launch date. School's acceptance of WhippleHill's work on the public Website shall occur on the earlier of the School's providing to WhippleHill written notice of acceptance, or forty-five (45) days after WhippleHill notifies the School of the Site Review start date.</li>
