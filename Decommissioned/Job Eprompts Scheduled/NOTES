DESCRIPTION
The script initially runs a Job record search to get Jobs with Pending emails (Eprompt not sent) filtered by date and opted for Eprompt option. For each search result, the script checks the following: 
1. Does this Job have any existing campaigns?
2. Does this Job have any existing messages?
3. Does this Course have any Eprompt tasks?
4. Does this Job have any participants?

If all conditions are met, the script creates an Email Campaign record (customrecord_emailcampaign) and an Email Message record (customrecord_emailmessage); a Mail job and a Mail queue (this involves a Web Service call to the Mind Gym Mail API URL).
